\chapter{Neural Networks}

\section{Net1}
Define the network, what was it, what was it meant to learn

\section{Net2}
Define it, why was it an improvement on net1?

\section{Evolutionary kernels}
Tried to use evol kerns but sparse nature of data means no good

\section{convNet}
Define it what did it learn and what happened.
Alternative approach of using evol kerns on full image

\section{Attentional Networks}
Zooming in around the most current event

\section{Auto Encoder}
How much could be cleaned up
Retry other networks with cleaned up data.
