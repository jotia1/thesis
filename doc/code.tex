\chapter{Software, datasets and implementation comments}

\section{Software repository}
All software produced for and metioned in this thesis can be accessed from GitHub using the link; \hyperref[https://github.com/jotia1/thesis]{https://github.com/jotia1/thesis}.

\section{Dataset and results access}
The original DVS recordings and ground truth logs for 8AD, AAD and multi-dot total more than 5 Gb and can be accessed at \hyperref[https://goo.gl/PT1y88]{https://goo.gl/PT1y88}.
All network models with tensorboard logs, sample images and pre-processed data took over 100 Gb of hard drive space.
Representative models (saved in Tensorflow's format) of the working networks are available from the same link as the datasets.

\section{Implementation comments}
% Actual results will be deleted
Tensorflow network implementations were written in Python version 3.5.1 and run with Tensorflow version 0.7 installed on The University of Queensland's Goliath computing cluster. 
Tesla K80 GPUs were used whilst training models. Testing was done on a Dell XPS 13 inch laptop.
Pre-processing and analysis was done in a combination of Python and Matlab (R2015b).
