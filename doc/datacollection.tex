\section{The need for a dataset}

\section{Requirements}
Simple, ground truth, 

\section{Considerations}
Flashes on screen -> noise
Segmenting datasets
Line angles (Close to edge, just a tiny segment in corner)
Ground truth to actual recording consideration (mitigated through setup?)
Light invariance
Black on white and white on black, grey
Hot pixels

\section{Methodology}
What did i actually end up doing

\section{Final dataset specifications}


\section{Comments}
Looking back at the data what do i think?
Flat timestamps?? -> experimental hardware
Segmenting looses a lot on each side
No metric for validating ground truth against actual dot accuracy
Camera angles (parallel lines not so).
